Description: ASpedia-R is an application to explore the comprehensive multi-omics profile of human splicing event regions.
            Our database covers various sequence features encompassing DNA, RNA, and protein located in spliced exonic regions.
            To interrogate sequence features existing around splicing events, 
            our package provides the retrieval system to search sequence features from AS event profile.
